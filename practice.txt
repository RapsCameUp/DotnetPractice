Slide 2: Introduction
Key Points:
The rise of digital technology has exposed vulnerabilities in traditional authentication methods like passwords and biometrics.
There’s a need for advanced, secure solutions to protect sensitive data.
The project proposes using full body re-identification combined with liveness checks to enhance security.
Slide 3: Problem Statement
Key Points:
Traditional authentication methods (passwords, PINs, fingerprints) are increasingly vulnerable to phishing, brute force attacks, and leaks.
Biometric methods like fingerprints and facial recognition face spoofing and irreversible compromise risks.
Challenge: How do we develop a more secure, harder-to-spoof authentication mechanism?
Slide 4: Proposed Solution
Title: Full Body Re-identification with Liveness Check
Key Points:
Full body re-identification leverages physical attributes for authentication.
Liveness checks ensure the person is physically present and not a photo/video.
This combination offers enhanced security, reducing the vulnerabilities of traditional biometrics and passwords.
Slide 5: Architecture
Title: System Architecture Overview
Diagram: Include a flowchart diagram showing the following steps:
Image Input (Full body image captured)
Feature Extraction (HOG features, or Deep Learning features with TensorFlow in comparison)
Liveness Detection (Checks for live person, not a static image)
Re-identification (Matching the extracted features with the database)
Decision (Access Granted/Denied)
Slide 6: Dataset
Title: Dataset – Market-1501
Key Points:
Market-1501: A standard dataset for person re-identification, containing over 32,000 images of 1,501 identities.
Images captured from multiple angles and locations.
Training set: Bounding box images used for feature extraction and model training.
Validation set used to evaluate the model performance.
Slide 7: Data Processing
Title: Data Processing Pipeline
Key Points:
Image Preprocessing: Resizing images, converting to grayscale.
Feature Extraction:
Without deep learning: HOG features extracted using classical computer vision techniques.
With deep learning: Using TensorFlow’s MobileNetV2 for comparison.
Labels: Labels extracted from image filenames to associate with specific identities.
Saving Features: Storing features and labels as .npy files for easy access.
Slide 8: Metrics
Title: Performance Metrics
Key Points:
Accuracy: Correct identification rate from the dataset.
Validation Accuracy: Accuracy measured on unseen validation data.
Precision, Recall, F1 Score: To evaluate model performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize true positives, false positives, false negatives, etc.
Slide 9: Model Comparison (with and without TensorFlow)
Title: Model Comparison: Traditional vs Deep Learning Approach
Key Points:
Traditional (HOG + SVM):
Uses classical computer vision techniques.
Less computationally expensive.
Performs well on smaller datasets but limited in scale.
Deep Learning (MobileNetV2 with TensorFlow):
Extracts more detailed, complex features.
Performs better on large datasets like Market-1501.
More robust to variations in lighting, angle, etc.
Results:
TensorFlow achieves higher accuracy, but HOG + SVM offers simpler and faster processing.
Slide 10: Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization
Title: Tuning the Model
Key Points:
SVM Parameters (HOG Model): Regularization parameter (C) tuned for the best performance.
Neural Network Parameters (Deep Learning Model):
Learning rate.
Dropout rate for regularization.
Best results obtained through experimentation and validation.
Slide 11: Liveness Detection Integration
Title: Liveness Detection
Key Points:
Liveness checks ensure the system is interacting with a live person, not an image or video.
Techniques can include blink detection, motion tracking, or pulse detection via the camera.
Enhances security by preventing spoofing attacks.
Slide 12: Conclusion
Key Points:
Full body re-identification combined with liveness detection significantly enhances the security of authentication systems.
Classical methods like HOG + SVM can be effective for smaller-scale tasks, but deep learning offers superior performance for large-scale, real-world applications.
This approach addresses the vulnerabilities of traditional authentication methods, offering a more robust solution for secure data access.
Slide 13: Future Work
Key Points:
Explore real-time implementation of liveness checks with camera feeds.
Combine additional biometric factors, such as gait analysis, for more robust identification.
Further optimize deep learning models for faster inference in low-resource environments.
